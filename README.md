# DO NOT USE THIS, AS IT WILL BREAK YOUR SERVER...i think

### Update: 1.4.3 ###
* Rewrote the CTPPotionEffect to use Craftbukkit's APIs
* Removed a bunch of commented out code, if you want it back look up the stuff in the github history prior to this commit.
* Tried to get all the sendMessage to use the one on the main class, and to try and get all the other sendMessages to look the same across the board.
